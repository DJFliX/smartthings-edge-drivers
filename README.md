# smartthings-edge-drivers

Hi! I basically cloned https://github.com/veonua/SmartThingsEdge-Xiaomi and eliminated everything except for the device I am working on. Since the SDK doesn't support Single data type I can't actually read the TVOC values, but other than that I think everything is working. I must note that the battery % thing is 100% copy pasta and while it shows 100% for me, it might be incorrect. Let's see :)

Oh, and just now I've added code that I've copied from https://github.com/iquix/ST-Edge-Driver/tree/master/ikea-shortcut-button since for some reason iquix doesn't publish that specific driver any more.
